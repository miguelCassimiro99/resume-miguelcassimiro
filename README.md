# resume-miguelcassimiro

A simple resume developed with Bootstrap 4


The mainly component os Bootstrap 4 applied on this resume was nav-pills, that was put inside a navbar.
If you access by a desktop, you can click on the profile picture that will make the navbar expand, showing the options to choice.
If you're in a mobile device, the navbar will be placed by top. So you just have to touch on the name to see the options.

#sections:
  - about
  - experience
  - education
  - skills
  - interests
  - awards

On the Experince section, I used a card component with accordion, so, if you click/touch on each card, will be able to see a little paragraph with the information about each item. Choosing one of the cards, the other that is actualy open will automatically close.
